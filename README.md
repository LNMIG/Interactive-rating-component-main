# Frontend - Interactive rating component

## Welcome!
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge I participated in.

**To do this challenge, I needed a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## This is what I was challenged to create

## The challenge was
- Build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- Use any tools one likes to help complete the challenge.

## As result of the code
Any user is able to:
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## What I learned
Well, I used all the knowledge I had about HTML, CSS and JS. The most important side of this challenge is that it forced me to check back and reinforce some knowledge I already have.
I think this is a good way to keep our minds and knowledge working together and updated.
